This project implements a secure login form with specific validation requirements for the username and password fields. Upon successful login with a predefined password, users are redirected to a dashboard page that contains interactive components. Additionally, there is a "Forgot your password" link that allows users to initiate a password reset by sending an email to support@smartserv.io.
